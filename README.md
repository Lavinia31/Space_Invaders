# Space_Invaders

In this project, a Space Invaders game was developed using a 16-character, 4-row alphanumeric LCD display. The process involved programming an ATmega164A microcontroller to manage the game display and ensure its proper functioning, using the C Code Vision AVR compiler. Additionally, the hardware components were assembled using through-hole technology (THT) and surface-mount technology (SMT)
